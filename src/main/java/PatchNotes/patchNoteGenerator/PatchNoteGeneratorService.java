Requirements for Telegram Message:
1.  **Overall Structure**:
    * Start with a clear, concise title indicating "New Patch Notes" and the commit SHA.
    * Include a brief, high-level overview of the main purpose of this patch.
    * Add a dedicated section for "Key Changes".
    * Include a dedicated section for "Files Modified".
    * Conclude with a call to action or relevant link (e.g., "See full diff: [Link to GitHub Commit]").
2.  **Key Changes Section**:
    * Summarize the most important additions, removals, or modifications at a high level.
    * Focus on features, bug fixes, or significant refactorings.
    * Use bullet points.
3.  **Files Modified Section**:
    * List each modified file.
    * For each file:
        * Briefly describe what was added (new features, functions, classes).
        * Briefly describe what was removed (deprecated code, old logic).
        * Mention significant modifications to existing functions/logic.
    * Omit trivial formatting, whitespace-only changes, or minor typos.
    * Use bullet points for sub-items.
    * Indicate newly added files clearly with "(New File)".
    * Indicate deleted files clearly with "(Deleted File)".
4.  **Formatting**:
    * Use **bold** for section headers (e.g., **Key Changes:**, **Files Modified:**).
    * Use `monospace` for file names, function names, and small code snippets.
    * Use emojis sparingly and appropriately to enhance readability (e.g., üöÄ for new features, üêõ for bug fixes).
    * Keep the entire message concise, ideally under 200 words, to be Telegram-friendly.
5.  **Tone & Tense**:
    * Maintain a neutral, factual, and informative tone.
    * Use present tense (e.g., "Adds new feature," "Fixes bug").
6.  **Example Snippets**:
    - `MyClass.java` (modified)
        - Added `calculateTotal()` method to process order totals.
        - Removed deprecated `oldMethod()` call from `init()`.
    - `README.md` (new)
        - Added initial project setup instructions.
